# Arrays & Strings

## Exercises

### Ex 01: Is Unique
- Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use any additional data structure ?
- Hints:
    - Try using a hash table
    - Could a bit vector be useful ?
    - Can you solve it in O(n log(n)) time ?

### Ex 02: Check Permutation
- Given two strings, write a method to check if one is permutation of the other
- Hints:
    -   Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other. Now, look at
        hat definition you provided. Can you check the strings against that definition ?
    -   There is one solution that is 0( N log N) time. Another solution uses some space, but
        is O(N) time. 
    -   Could a hash table be useful? 
    -   Two strings that are permutations should have the same characters, but in different orders. Can you make the orders the same?
